twitter-history-elasticsearch
==============================

Requirements:
-------------
 - Authorized Twitter API credentials
 - A running ElasticSearch 1.0.0+ instance
 - 'head' plugin for ElasticSearch (`elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head`)
 - 'marvel' plugin for ElasticSearch (`elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/marvel/latest`)

This example includes three separate jars: one for indexing tweets, one for indexing activities, and one for indexing retweets.
Each of these jars require a corresponding configuration file that defines both Twitter and ElasticSearch preferences

Example Configuration:
----------------------

    twitter {
        host = "api.twitter.com"
        endpoint = "statuses/user_timeline"
        oauth {
            consumerKey = ""
            consumerSecret = ""
            accessToken = ""
            accessTokenSecret = ""
        }
        follow = [
            42232950
        ]
    }
    elasticsearch {
        hosts = [
            localhost
        ]
        port = 9300
        clusterName = elasticsearch
        index = userhistory_activity
        type = activity
    }

In the Twitter section you should place all of your relevant authentication keys and whichever Twitter IDs you're looking to follow
Twitter IDs can be converted from screennames at http://www.gettwitterid.com

Running:
--------

You will need to run `./install_templates.sh` in the resources folder in order to apply the templates to your ES cluster

Once the configuration file has been completed and the templates installed, this example can be run with:
`java -cp target/twitter-history-elasticsearch-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dconfig.file=src/main/resources/application.conf org.apache.streams.twitter.example.TwitterHistoryElasticsearchActivity`

Verification:
-------------
Open up http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/ and confirm that all three indices now have data in them

Download https://github.com/w2ogroup/streams-examples/blob/master/twitter-history-elasticsearch/src/main/resources/reports/ActivityReport.json

Open up http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel and from the folder icon in the top right hand corner click
    Load -> Advanced -> Choose File and select the report you downloaded

The gear on the top-right allows you to change the report index

You should now see dashboards displaying metrics about your twitter activity
